# BH-MosquePrayer
MosquePrayer is an open-source app designed to provide accurate prayer times and iqama timings for mosques in Bahrain. With a focus on encouraging mosque attendance, the app features a streak counter to track your prayers performed in mosques. The current version will be built using Godot, with the flexibility to switch technologies in the future.
