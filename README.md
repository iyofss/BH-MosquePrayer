# BH-MosquePrayer
MosquePrayer is an open-source app designed to provide accurate prayer times and iqama timings for mosques in Bahrain. With a focus on encouraging mosque attendance, the app features a streak counter to track your prayers performed in mosques. The current version will be built using Godot, with the flexibility to switch technologies in the future.

Currently, the app only shows the prayer time and the iqama offset, You can manually set the iqama offset with the name of your mosque.

In the future, the app will have a list of most if not all mosques in Bahrain, with its iqama offset, Yet, there is still a chance of the iqama offset getting changed, therefore there will be a report function to report any faulty iqama offset, by doing so, I will be able to spot them and update the dataset of the mosque.
